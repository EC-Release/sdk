#### Prologue
In July '20, GE Digital (Predix) was hired to have an internal evaluation over the current production agent (v1) and service (1.0). The exercise was mainly focused on its network traffic security practice up to HTTP level. EC @R&D had put up an action plan and executing it accordingly. The detail is as follows.

#### Business Resources
- [Project board](https://github.com/EC-Release/sdk/projects/18)
- [The codebase](https://gitlab.com/digital-fo/connectivity/enterprise-connect/platform-agnostic/agent/-/tree/v1_sourcecode_update_pentest)
- [Original Draft (Internal)](https://ge.ent.box.com/file/694822011858)
- [Stakeholders](https://github.com/orgs/Enterprise-connect/teams/ec-stakeholders)

#### Author
 - [Research & Develoment @EC](https://github.com/orgs/EC-Release/teams/research-development)

#### Research Standards
 - [HTTP/1.1 (RFC-2616)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616)
 - [HTTP Message Syntax and Routing (RFC-7230)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)

#### Findings vs. Feedback
##### Report Item [3699](https://github.com/EC-Release/sdk/issues/125)
  - The vulnerability on EC configruation during the HTTP call is acknowledged. We are proposing an encryption library ([code snippet](https://gitlab.com/digital-fo/connectivity/enterprise-connect/platform-agnostic/agent/-/blob/v1_sourcecode_update_pentest/pentest.go#L10)) as part of new cipher procedure during the call.
  - Upon an internal review, the security library will be intruduced in the next agent release (v1.hokkaido.213)
##### Report Item [3704](https://github.com/EC-Release/sdk/issues/121)
  - The item found the usage of the loopback address vulnerable to an attack[1]. It also suggests that it is impractical to volunteerily trust any given proxy service[2].
  - [1]A request acceptance over a loopback address was designed for local test purpose. Propose to remove the exception in the current ipfiltering flow([code snippet](https://gitlab.com/digital-fo/connectivity/enterprise-connect/platform-agnostic/agent/-/blob/v1_sourcecode_update_pentest/wzlib/wzutil/ipfilter.go#L48)). A tester will then be required whitelist the loopback address at the gateway setting. This is a minimum business-impact item.
  - [2]In the suggestion of limiting the range of the proxy service, we found such limitation may discourage the service adoption, and further impose a maximum business impact due to an unknown httpproxy service setting applied to existing usage. Propose to add a custom flag(s) to restrict an acceptable range of proxy usage in the gateway setting.
