## Secruity Vulnerability Items
#### Prologue
In July '20, GE Digital (Predix) was hired to have internal evaluation over the current production agent (v1) and service (1.0). The exercise was mainly focused on its network traffic security practice up to HTTP level. EC @R&D had put up an action plan and executing it accordingly. The detail is as follows.

- [Original Draft (Internal)](https://ge.ent.box.com/file/694822011858)

#### The Findings vs. Feedback
- Report Item [3699](https://github.com/EC-Release/sdk/issues/125)
  - The vulnerability on EC configruation during the HTTP call is acknowledged. We are proposing an encryption library ([code snippet](https://gitlab.com/digital-fo/connectivity/enterprise-connect/platform-agnostic/agent/-/blob/v1_sourcecode_update_pentest/pentest.go#L10)) as part of new cipher procedure during the call.
  - Upon an internal review, the security library will be intruduced in the next agent release (v1.hokkaido.213)
