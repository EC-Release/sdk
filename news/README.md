## Release Theme (2021.10)

### Visualisation. A Unified Control-Plane
EC Portal which currently in beta, providing subscribers the first-hand experience in visualising the connectivty via the existing agent (1.x/2.x) topology. Additionally, it further enables the process-level control-access with a browser-basis unix terminal without any dependancies from any ISVs. All you need is a modern browser to unlease the power of the control-plane.
### Segmental Business Governance
Since 2.x beta release (introduced in the 4rd quarter '20), EC @R&D began pivoting on its tenency model named Security-Domain Controller (SDC). The tenancy model @SDC not only gives the security governance back to individual subscriber/business unit, but assists the EC connectivity-as-a-service to achieve the **true De-Centralisation** governancy (based on [LIBRA, an opensource blockchain project](https://github.com/LIBRA-Release/libra)), making the **"De-Central"** no longer just a slogan. 
### Machine-Driven Business Operation
Engineers @EC embrace automation. With LEAN Agile doctrine in mind, our presence (Genba げんば), and always improving/revolutionary towards our productivity (Kaizn 改善する) are the ultimate form of LEAN Engineering pratice. The automation/CI @EC takes centre off the SDLC for entire EC product family, serving our subscribers with cutting-edge service renewal process which helps to minimise a service downtime and to mitigate any potential service disruption for any industrial business adoption.
### Behavioral Data Persistency
@EC, we do not expose any usage data owned by the subscribers to any authoritative business/entities and instead, EC provides a set of software utilities (e.g. distributed/embedded dataset) to collect the connectivity of data usage (optional) to help our subscribers better understand the usage for any business purposes.
### Zero-Trust Security
@EC, we give the security privilige/our loyalty to our subscribers. We do not worship, or voluntarily give-in the domain trust to any cloud providers/vendors (i.e. aws, azure, gcloud) even it means to be a **"managed"** opensource project, this is to maintain the sustainable security model with Zero-tolerant No-trust policy promoted by National Institute of Standards and Technology ([NIST No-Trust paper](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf)), and aligning with our continue effort in chartering with [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/).
